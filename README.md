### Basic Data Exploration with pandas on Bikeshare Data
This Python project focuses on using the pandas library to explore bikeshare data. The dataset includes information from three major U.S. cities: Chicago, Washington, and New York City. The goal is to perform descriptive analysis and display relevant information, such as popular days and common stations.

### Description
1. The program prompts the user to input the desired city (e.g., Chicago), the month they want to analyze (including an ‘all’ option), and the specific day they are interested in (also with an ‘all’ option).
2. After receiving user input, the program offers the option to view raw data (initially displaying 5 rows). Following this, it provides the following details:
 - Most popular month
 - Most popular day
 - Most popular hour
 - Most popular start station
 - Most popular end station
 - Most common combination of start and end stations
 - Total trip duration
 - Average trip duration
 - Number of users by type
 - Gender distribution of users (if available)
 - Oldest user (if available)
 - Youngest user (if available)
 - Most common birth year among users (if available)
3. Finally, the user is given the choice to restart the program or exit.
